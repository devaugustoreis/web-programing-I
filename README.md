This repository contains the code and exercises I developed for the "web development 1" classes in the "System Analysis and Development" graduation at IFSC. This subject was taken in the second semester of 2023 and its focus was to learn and practice plain HTML, CSS and Javascript, without any frameworks. Some of the topics covered were:

- **HTML:** Basic DOM structure

- **HTML - tags common attributes:** href, src, title, type, target, alt, name, id, class, value, required, placeholder, size, maxlength, minlength, rows, cols, rowspan, colspan, action, method, etc
- **CSS:** inline, internal or external

Check some code demonstration from this repository below:

## Flexbox Demonstration
Studies about the CSS flexbox layout. 

#### Lista de Exercícios 4 (Flexbox) - Questão 2
The proposal of the exercise below was to copy an existing website interface and I chose YouTube for it. As the focus was to mimic the visual interface, the webpage is purely visual (HTML and CSS only) and there are no working functionalities.

#### Lista de Exercícios 4 (Flexbox) - Questão 5
I developed the code below to test (almost) all of the flexbox properties for both "parent" (flex container) and "children" (flex items).

## Grid Demonstration
Studies about the CSS Grid layout. 

#### Lista de Exercícios 5 (Grid) - Questão 2
The objective of the exercise below was to develop a generic website layout utilizing CSS grid property.

## Calculator
The calculator below was developed as part of one of the tests to be approved. However, I added some extra features by myself to practice even further. I also added a serie of validations to prevent the calculator from being broken by illegal operations.

## Task List
The task list below was also developed as part of one of the tests to be approved. The objective was to practice basic CRUD operations with JS and Local Storage (no API/backend). I also took this opportunity to practice the use of bootstrap and Jquery.
